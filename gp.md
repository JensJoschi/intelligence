**Summary**  

Academic parents often struggle to balance career and family. These struggles are likely exacerbated when children have additional physical, social or educational needs, which may severely reduce the career prospective of parents. Being more intelligent than the average population, scientists are also more likely to have intellectually gifted children, which pose unique challenges in comparison to neurotypical children. We plan to study the prevalence of "gifted" children among academic parents in evolutionary biology and ecology, identify factors that affect scientific productivity and family mental well-being, and estimate the likelihood of attrition from the STEMM work market for families with special needs. The … grant enables us to develop questionnaires and distribute them at x major scientific conferences. The outcomes will be presented on the ... conference in ... , and will be accompanied by networking events for academic parents with gifted children.
 


**introduction**   

Family obligations put a burden on STEMM careers. Financial insecurity, short-term contracts and frequent absence (conferences, field-work) are difficult to reconcile with parenting obligations (Schroeder et al., 2013; Bar et al., 2017; Hooker et al., 2017). These factors drive parents, and mothers in particular, out of STEMM fields (Cech and Blair-Loy, 2019). One can easily imagine that any further disabilities or special needs in the family increase the burden on a healthy work-family balance and thus add to the attrition rate from STEMM fields.  
STEMM scientists are not a random draw of the population; for example, STEMM scientists are more likely to fall on the autism spectrum (Ruzich et al., 2015). The presumably largest difference to the general population is, however, the high intelligence of scientists. Intelligence is, like other personality traits, influenced by both genetical and environmental factors (e.g. Otto, APA), but regardless of an ongoing nature-nurture debate (e.g plomin, gould), there is broad consensus that parents with a high IQ are more likely to have high-IQ children. It is hence likely that the intelligence of academic children deviates from the population average.  
While it may seem that highly intelligent children are more independent and easier to raise than the average child, families with gifted children in fact face a multitude of problems. For example, highly intelligent children are easily bored, and bored children may become aggressive bullies or develop depression; lack of intellectual challenge can prevent or delay the development of crucial learning skills; and the typically strong will and high intensity makes parenting more stressful (refs for all).  In a competitive business in which voluntary work at weekends and outside office hours is the norm, it is hence reasonable to expect that families with special needs are academically less competitive.  
With this grant proposal, we want to identify the prevalence of gifted children in academic families, as well as the degree and the major factors that contribute to hampering academic careers. The x applicants will attend y conferences (names) between [time, something like 1 year] and distribute questionnaires to attendees. The organisers of (conference xyz) have offered their help to make attendees aware of our efforts and to help avoiding selection bias. 


**Outcomes**  

Prof. xy has ample experience in designing and evaluating scientific questionnaires; the data gathered is hence likely to yield scientifically valid insights, and we wish to submit them to [potential examples are Ecology and Evolution (section academic practice), PRoceedings B (academic practice), Elife] or similar academic outlets. All outcomes will also be presented on the ....[eseb?] conference in [...], along with efforts to form a community and support academic parents with gifted children.
