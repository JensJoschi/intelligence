# Summary  
This repo is meant to be a discussion forum about high intelligence in academic environments. Isn't is strange that we deal with highly intelligent students on a daily basis, are probably quite intelligent ourselves, yet do not discuss the term intelligence or talk to professionals on giftedness education?  
This repo is not about research _on_ giftedness / intelligence, I am not a psychologist. It is more about discussing the implications of high intelligence for our children, our teaching environment, and outreach options.  

Currently this repo has only a single draft that is meant to raise awareness about the problems our children may face due to their high intelligence. It could be expanded to "academic offspring", or teaching duties though. I am looking for collaborators/coauthors with different points of view (different country, age of children, twice-exceptional kids)!
