# Summary  
This repo is meant to be a discussion forum about high intelligence in academic environments. Isn't is strange that we deal with highly intelligent students on a daily basis, are probably quite intelligent ourselves, yet do not discuss the term intelligence or talk to professionals on "gifted and talented"/honors education?  
This repo is not about research _on_ intelligence, I am not a psychologist. It is more about discussing the implications of high intelligence for our children, our teaching environment, and outreach options.  


I am looking for **collaborators/coauthors** with different points of view (different country, honors vs non-honors teachers, neurodiverse staff, age of children, twice-exceptional kids)! 


Currently this repo has three drafts: 
- blog_post.docx is a blog post that has yet to find a home. Better read that one first. Everything else is still quite messy.
- gifted.md is a review draft, which is meant to raise awareness about the problems our children may face due to their high intelligence. 
- gp.md is a draft for a small grant proposal. Something for equal opportunities intiatives or the like
- teaching.md is an opinion piece/review with a bit of quantitative literature search. It is about teaching for highly intelligent students

All drafts are very preliminary and lack proper references.
