**Motivation**
My children are 5,4 and 1, and exceptionally bright. Fortunately the school of the two older kids made us aware about their high intelligence and took appropriate measures before problems became unbearable. Life is not always easy with gifted kids, but I know that many other parents are not that lucky, and will not know what is "wrong" with their children until much later in their children's lives. By then, some opportunities may be lost (underachievement), and the daily struggles may have left their marks on family harmony. This is why I want to raise awareness for problems of high intelligence.  

**Content**  
I am not a psychologist, all knowledge about the topic comes from standard guidebooks on parenting gifted children (Webb). It would definitively profit from a check by someone with more experience! Refs are also mostly taken from textbooks, potentially inaccurate, and often unchecked (many refs are to books I do not have access to).
This draft is an unfinished, preliminary list of topics I would like to cover. But essentially everything is up to discussion

# Abstract:  
Academic staff is usually intelligent, and intelligence is heritable. We discuss why the high intellectual ability of our children can be problematic, and how it affects academic careers. We urge for more conversation about gifted children, but also for a change in teaching culture with our academic offspring. 


1 _This article is written in light prose. By no means do we want to *verb* the many difficult problems arising from raising a gifted child or the hardships of a career with special family obligations (we experienced a fair bit ourselves). Instead we want to emphasize that giftedness is a gift, and the prose reflects that we count ourselves lucky to have particularly bright children_. 

# Intro   
Many academics suffer from a heritable condition: intelligence. Intelligence is, in short, the ability to solve problems (Gardner 1983), and undoubtedly a good predictor for academic success (ref) - Intelligence is associated with high reasoning ability, creativity (Piirto 2004), curiosity, leadership (Piirto 2004), a large vocabulary, and an excellent memory (more refs). Extremely high intelligence (an IQ of at least 130, two standard deviations above the mean) is, by definition, rare (2.3 %), but academics are hardly a representative sample of the population. Reliable numbers are difficult to come by, but the mean IQ of biology undergraduates is around 125 (Gibson and Light 1967), and can be expected to increase with career due to selection pressure of the competitive job market(ref). In other words, many academic staff are highly intelligent.
High intelligence is, of course, no disease (and unfortunately also not contagious), and it may almost be used as a synonym for "scientist". It is, however, associated with multiple mental issues, e.g. social isolation, underachievement and perfectionism (ref), especially in late(?) childhood (refs). We scientists are aware that most of us are intelligent and have a special personality (e.g. propensity for introvertism, Feist 1998; neuroticism, ref), and the scientific community is also increasingly aware of the dark sides of intelligence such as the impostor syndrome (refs). But scientists do also breed. Not only is high intelligence prevalent among scientists, it is also a largely heritable trait (Gottfredson 1997; Plomin and Petrill 1997; Sattler 2001; Plomin and Spinath 2002; Judge 2006); and (social) assortative mating is commonplace (ref). It follows that our children should violate any assumption of normality as well. Indeed x% of children from academic/science background are gifted (ref). Despite the potential problems of high intelligence, we have noted surprisingly little awareness in everyday communication with our peers. This may be because discussion about intelligence is viewed as elitist and riddled with myths (Treffinger 2009). We thus wish to review how intelligence usually manifests; what problems it causes; and what it means for academic parents and their success. But first we wish to define intelligence, giftedness, ability and talent, terms we commonly use interchangeably in our academic environment, but which in fact mean very different things.

# Intelligence, giftedness, ability and talent  
The term intelligence is much debated and continues to be ill-defined, but in general, intelligence is the ability to perceive, process, and retain or apply information (ref). Depending on the viewpoint, intelligence may contain multiple uncorrelated facets, such as interpersonal, visual and musical intelligence ("multiple intelligences", Gardner 1983), or be a set of correlated abilities such as verbal comprehension and logical reasoning ("g factor", ref). Whether intelligence is predominantly inherited or formed by the environment is similarly subject to debate (Clark 2002; Dweck 2006), but some commonly agreed core traits of cognitive abilities are highly heritable and more or less fixed after the age of school entry (Sattler 2001). Thus, intelligence is mainly seen as a potential. Social factors influence, however, how much of the potential is actually used, e.g. by providing knowledge, skills and opportunities (Dweck 2006; other refs). For the purpose of this review, we wish to simplify intelligence to those dimensions most needed and hence most selected for by our jobs: verbal intelligence and logical reasoning - in other words the traits IQ tests commonly measure (ref wechsler). In the following we will also equate this narrow definition of intelligence with the term giftedness (as is for example also used by Mensa), though we acknowledge that the term gifted also includes musical or sport talent (Marland 1972); NAGC).  
The terms"ability" and "talent" differ from above definitions of intelligence. They describe systematically developed skills and knowledge (Gagne 1991; Gagne 1999), including e.g. the ability to self-motivate, learning techniques, but also acting according to social codes. Again, the use of these terms varies depending on viewpoint (e.g. Gardner 1983; Dweck 2006). We will use this definition of learned skills to distinguish them from heritable traits. Ability is therefore highly subjective to the environment that is provided, causing for example poor neighborhoods and ethnic minorities to score consistently worse on ability tests (e.g. SAT in the US, ref). Nurturing or selecting the most "able" is therefore a way to perpetuate social injustice.  

# Phenotype of a gifted  
Public perception of a typical gifted child is largely influenced by media, which commonly depict highly intelligent children as pale mathematic geniuses or computer nerds (media refs). In real life, they are mostly normal: their hobbies may include football, meeting with friends, arguing with their siblings - and occasionally astronomy, science fairs or natural history museum visits. Nevertheless, gifted children are special. There are some character traits that mark the key to their personality (Webb et al. 2017), and some typical traits of gifted children frequently stand out: 
-	Accelerated development. Key skills such as language development, reading and math skills develop 30% faster than in an average child (Ruf and Ruf 2005)
-	Advanced vocabulary. Intelligent children are often able to understand and apply vocabulary that is beyond their biological age (technical terminology, xenisms), and correctly apply grammar rules many an adult has their problems with.
-	Curiosity. Gifted children are often driven by insatiable appetite for knowledge. The phase of intense questioning never stops [2-3 real world quotes], and many gifted children are prone to experimenting to find out how things work. This frequently leads to broken toys. And laptops, too [no, no broken laptop yet - real world example needed here].
-	Motivation. Highly intelligent children are easy to interest in a topic, but very difficult to detach. Combined with their appetite for knowledge, the drive of a child’s curiosity may quickly exceed standard Wikipedia knowledge (e.g. "Do deep sea sharks hunt anglerfish, or do anglerfish eat deep sea sharks?"; my 4yo.). 
-	Arguing, strong will. This is essentially the same point as above. Nobody said that the child’s motivation has to align with the intentions of its parents.
-	Unconventional thinking and humor. Highly intelligent people think outside the box. They may, for example, invent new rules in games, or change the game philosophy by taking rules too literally (e.g. in Monopoly a hotel costs 4 houses + money; if all houses are sold out, buying a hotel becomes impossible).
-	Activity levels. Gifted children are often very energetic.
-	High sensitivity. This refers to the integration of sensory (visual, tactile) cues, but also to deeper emotions and a highly developed moral thinking (Tucker and Lu Haferistein 1997; Lind 2011)

This list of "typical" traits is not exhaustive, as nearly every guidebook has its own list of unique traits, many of which are debatable (e.g. differences in sleep duration, ref; attention span of newborns, Abroms 1982), nor does every gifted child express all of them. High intelligence also comes with a high potential for variance in character traits, making the identification of giftedness difficult (Roedell et al. n.d.; Gagne 1991). Moreover, many children quickly learn to hide their abilities due to socio-emotional problems they confer (see below). Hence many gifted children remain undiagnosed until problems occur; but even then, many school staff and psychologists are not sufficiently trained, frequently leading to misdiagnoses. Especially in the US school system, group tests (e.g. SAT) are commonly applied, and one may think that these tests the need for individually identifying the highly intelligent. These tests are, however, inadequate for at least four reasons: 1) They come too late, identification should ideally already occur in preschool, so that the child can grow in a nourishing atmosphere; 2) they measure ability not intelligence (despite using a similar definition which targets the top 2%); 3) they are vulnerable to prior preparation classes; to some extend they measure socioeconomic status rather than ability; 4) they are directed at identifying problems at the lower end of the intelligence spectrum, the resolution at the upper end is thus low (ceiling effects). Personalized IQ-tests, on the other hand, are expensive. Due to these challenges, the best chances to correctly identify the needs of highly intelligent children is by awareness of the parents.

# Problems of the child  
Gifted children are especially at risk for psychological stress, though also more resilient (Neihart 1999) 
One would expect that high intelligence leads to good grades, academic success and a high quality of life. While this trajectory may be true for some highly intelligent people,  many gifted children struggle at least for a period of their life. The high intelligence and early success at school is at the same time a source of problems: Motivation arises from succeeding at challenging tasks (ref). A child will not maintain high motivation if it is not challenged frequently. On top of this, teachers and parents may actively (and unintentionally) demotivate a child, e.g. by telling it that it should only start reading and writing once it enters school age. In the beginning, the lack of motivation may not cause great harm. A gifted child often requires less repetition to understand and apply new concepts, so it may be able to get by without extra effort. Later in life, when materials become more challenging (secondary school or university), however, grades (and with it, self-esteem) may rapidly decline, as the child never developed appropriate learning skills or techniques to self-motivate. In fact, 10-20% of high school dropouts are gifted (Colangelo and Davis 1991).
-	Social problems
-	Self-awareness
-	Perfectionism -> impostor syndrome
-	Asymmetric development (normal social or motoric skills paired with high intelligence; or extremely high verbal skills but low skills in logical reasoning)

-	Problems increase with iq
-	High intelligence does not prevent any other mental issues, except low intelligence (ref). Learning disorders and "twice-exceptional" children are particularly problematic because the symptoms may cancel each other out, leading to no diagnosis/treatment until late in childhood; or to treatment of only one issue while ignoring the other. On the other hand, gifted children often resemble traits of  ADS/ADHD, because they often either refuse tasks or quickly lose interest when they are bored, and because they often have problems regulating their activity levels when they are excited (motivated). Other gifted children may be confused with Asperger syndrome, because they may have peculiar interests and may also be socially awkward.

# Problems and opportunities for academic parents  
Given the long list of potential challenges, it is easy to understand that rearing a gifted child provides unique challenges (Karnes et al. 1984). 67% of fathers and 80% of mothers felt that their child has been difficult to rear, compared to 40/44 of parents of non-gifted children (Morawska and Sanders 2009). Nevertheless high intelligence does not constitute a special need in many countries(refs), which may be a good thing as it does not become needlessly pathologized (ref). Indeed, gifted children are also intensely rewarding. The above-mentioned problems of/with gifted children apply to every family. But, there are problems and opportunities directly arising from being an academic. These relate mainly to identification challenges, a healthy work-life balance, and nomadic life styles.

### identification  
preschool development is most important for mental and emotional development (Webb et al. 2017). Thus early identification is important. However, the academic background of the parents may initially cause teachers to attribute the curiosity, knowledge and other intelligence - related traits to parental effects rather than an intrinsic property of the child. For example, a 3-year old may correct his kindergarten teacher and childsplain the difference between bugs and beetles. Against a poor family background this level of verbal proficiency, reasoning and knowledge might be surprising, but if the parents are entomologists the intellectual abilities may hardly be noticed. Moreover, other academic parents (and some readers of this text) can relate to the typical problems and special traits of a gifted child, creating a false impression that this behaviour is "normal". While those factors may contribute to an initial lack of detection and treatment, the high socioeconomic status makes it statistically more probable that giftedness of their children will be detected (in comparison to poor and minorities). 
-	gifted children of academic background also have a better chance to cope with it even if undetected (phenotypic plasticity)
-	nevertheless things could be improved

### work-life balance  
-	Sleep deprivation (smart kids sleep less)
-	High responsibility (Meckstroth 1990; Feldman and Piirto 1995; Garn et al. 2012) - Also ref to imposter syndrome of parents. 
-	Time-consuming dialogue with school + many deadlines = bad
-	Work - life balance (museums/science communication stuff in free time)
-	Additional pressure due to high socioeconomic status
-	Academic parents are probably bad advisors - possibly highly achieving and not understanding	
But:
-	(usually) good grades and success
-	Understanding and reasonable children

### Moving  
-	choice of school is limited by short-term contracts and short preparation times
-	dialogue with school impeded, also due to language barriers (Europe)
-	Detection may be retarded by change of teachers
-	Social network of the child
-	Social network of the parent
-	Children’s high sensitivity to change
-	migrants(Germany) or ethnic minorities (US) less likely to e diagnosed. Partly due to socioeconomic reasons, but partly to language problems (IQ tests)
	But: 
-	Change in cultures + language = enrichment
-	Disruption of social network = away from bullies
-	Nevertheless: Particularly bad in ecr phase with young children

# Getting help  
-	Schools, doctors, psychologists? Unlikely.
-	Societies for gifted children
-	Network of academic parents

# Academic "offspring"  
-	Change of teaching culture necessary?
-	School teachers often think no help required (Seligman 1998); but high ability requires special treatment (Ruf and Ruf 2005; NEUBAUER and Stern 2009; Webb et al. 2017)
-	40% of best high school finishers drop out from college (Colangelo and Davis 1991)

# Glossary 
This review is primarily meant for readers in biology, so we (ab-)use some common terminology. As the content of this review is of potential importance to any scientist, however, we decode the terminology in this glossary.
- adaptation
- Assortative mating. Many species, including humans, tend to find partners with similar attributes. in this context it means that academics likely mate with other academics, thus producing clever kids. 
- Assumption of normality: A pun relating to common problems in statistics. In this case it means that academic children may not be perceived as normal ("outliers").
- Evolve/evolution: process by which selection pressure and random genetic drift cause differences in phenotype frequencies, gradually changing means and frequency distributions of phenotypes. 
- Heritability. Children are similar to their parents, and heritability describes by how much variance among children can be attributed to genetic effects. We acknowledge that socio-economic factors may influence intelligence in early childhood, too, but this is outside the scope of this review
- High-risk group: 
- Parental effects: A pun on a form of non-genetic inheritance. Environmental factors acting on the parents (e.g. malnutrition) can be passed on to the children without being "in the genes". Here we refer to parental provisioning, that is provision of learning material, habitus and soft skills that are taught by academic parents
- Phenotype: good definition. in this case it means the skills and mindset of gifted children that differentiate it from a "normal" child
- Phenotypic plasticity: means that organisms can react to environmental cues and behave accordingly. In this case it means that students can do okayish even in unfavourable school environments.
- Population sampling. This is a reference to common problems in field-experiments and in psychology. It means that academics are not representative of the overall population on which the 2.3% estimate is based.
- Selection pressure. Generally means differences in mortality or offspring production due to environmental factors. In this case, however, we actually mean differences in tenure chances due to intelligence as "selection criterium"
- mutualism: term from community ecology which describes species interacting in such a way that both benefit. This term should be the standard model of researcher - student relationships, but even more so for gifted students.
